Assignment 1 - 9/10/2019
NanoGui interaction structions:

VARIABLE a: set the rotate angle degree with local X axis. (deault: 30)
VARIABLE b: set the rotate angle degree with global Y axis. (default: 45)
Modifying the angle degree by double click on the number and type in new degree. 

BUTTON 'Reset': reset bunny's location and also reset a = 0 and b = 0.

BUTTON 'Rotate_X_Local': rotate bunny around local X axis.

BUTTON 'Rotate_Y_Global': rotate bunny around global Y axis, and keep the local coordinate system relevant still to bunny. In this case the local X axis is always towards to the rabbit tail.

BUTTON 'Rotate Both': same to apply both 'Rotate_X_Local' and 'Rotate_Y_Global' at the same time.
